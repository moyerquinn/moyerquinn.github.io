How is the jQuery file being loaded into this project: direct download or Content Delivery Network (CDN)?

    CDN, because it is downloading from another outside source

If you load the index.js file before the jquery file our program doesn't work. Why? Open the preview in a new tab and look at the console to help you find out why.

    The contents of the javascript file are jQuery resources, so the program doesn't know how to handle them before the jQuery file is established
